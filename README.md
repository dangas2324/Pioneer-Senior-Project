This app will primarily be used for a missionary in a foreign country that is trying to learn an unwritten language. 
They need to be able to take a picture of an object, have a local say the word on a voice recording, then be able to 
tag the voice recording to the object. With this they need to be able to create notecards and there should be an 
interactive image game that allows the user to learn the language in a fun way.
